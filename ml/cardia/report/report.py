"""Comprehensive CardiaSense HLS-CMDS benchmark report generator.

Produces a narrative PDF + PowerPoint deck: each figure is accompanied by
contextual explanation (what it shows, how to read it, what it means), plus
methodology, results, limitations and next steps. All numbers are pulled from
the campaign outputs so the prose stays accurate.

Usage:
  python -m cardia.report.report \
      --binary-out runs --mc-out /media/tnzr/AuxVolume/cardiasense-runs/mc \
