    "Late Diastolic Murmur": (
        "A murmur was detected in late diastole.",
        "Late-diastolic murmurs can occur with mitral stenosis or other valve conditions. They are best "

        "A murmur was detected during mid-systole.",
        "Mid-systolic (ejection) murmurs are common and often innocent, but can accompany aortic or "
        "pulmonary valve disease. A clinician can judge whether further testing is needed.",

        "A murmur was detected in late systole.",

    "Coarse Crackles": (
        "Coarse crackles were detected.",
        "Coarse crackles are lower-pitched bubbling sounds that can indicate secretions or fluid in the "

    ),
    "Rhonchi": (
        "Rhonchi were detected.",
        "Rhonchi are low-pitched rattling sounds from larger airways, often due to mucus. They may ease with "
